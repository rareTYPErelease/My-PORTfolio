    <h2>  What Goes On In THeir Minds...</h2> 
    <p> 
        Since we now know who an introvert and extrovert is,lets sink in into their minds üß†  for a little bit .
        If you actually take time to think about it,Introverts are very interesting people.
        What differentiates them from the Extroverts is only how they handle their things so lets see 
        how an introvert handles different events and situations.<br><br>
        
        lets take the case of a university student who happens to be an introvert.Sally`s her nameüë©‚Äçüéì .You may find 
        that in an ongoing class,being an Introvert,her mind will tend to think and wonder in so many places and it 
        almost feels as if she has a whole solar system running in her head.
        And thats why in most cases you will find such a person very quiet in class and contributes when necessary .<br><br>
        
        unfortunately it can get uncomfortable when her minds keeps wondering and she cant stop and concentrate 
        in a class .A lecturer may happen to notice and mistake her lack of concentration to being uninterested on what is going on.üò¢
        Being in a class setting can be way out of an introverts comfort zone and this makes them very anxious and uncomfortable  .But to others they just seem quiet and antisocial.Alot goes on in the inside.<br><br>
        
        They take high consideration to what people think about them and how people take them.
        An introvert will do all he/she can to avoid small talks because they value their "me time" and 
        are comfortable with it ,while other people start small talks to kill the silence .
        Extroverts tend to be stimulated by events such as partiesü•≥  but for introverts,despite the crowd they feel 
        very lonely and uncomfortable .
        Being an Introvert doesnt necessarily mean that you are shy but as Psychology today explains,
  
        "Introverts are drained by social encounters and are energized by solitary,peace and quiet."><br><br>
        
        Introversion defines a group of people who are focussed inward rather than outward and 
        they can be social at the same time if  need be ofcourse.
        They do everything after very careful thought and planning and this is why sally can take more time to 
        answer a question‚ùî  in class than other students And this can be misinterpretted to being uninteligent .
        Its sad but its just the truth .An introvert will enjoy opening up in writtingüìñ   instead  of actual words .<br><br>
        
        A downside to being an introvert comes in when they avoid excessive stimulation and dont engage in enough 
        external activity to give their mindsüß†  something to do beside cannibalizing itself.
        Am not trying to illustrate that being an Introvert is a curse or something but there are some things,
        that peple need to know about these people since its not written on their foreheads
        We need to judge less and ask more questions instead..<br><br> 
        Its amazing how these people are almost never bored .If they run out of things to do,their own thoughts 
        and imagination could keep them busy for a really long time ‚è≤ . <br><br>
        
        Being an Introvert isnt that bad, as Marsh Pinto writes in the article <cite>" 6 reasons why 
        you should appreciate Introverts"</cite> published by <strong> Huffington post : </strong><blockquote>
        "while extroverts may speak every thought that hits their mind,an Introvert will filter their thoughts 
        and only speak of the ones that they think are best to share ."</blockquote><br><br>
